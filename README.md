Aliens-R-Real!

Aliens R Real and so is this javascript code!

The idea of this project is to present data about UFO sighting and display them on a webpage in a table that can be filtered according to date of sighting. I started out by using js to loop through the data and append rows for each sighting to the nascent table, using d3 to do so. After that, I looped through again to add the actual data to the row that was appended for it in the previous step.
