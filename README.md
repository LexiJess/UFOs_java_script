Aliens-R-Real!

Aliens R Real and so is this javascript code!

The idea of this project is to present data about UFO sighting and display them on a webpage in a table that can be filtered according to date of sighting. I started out by using js to loop through the data and append rows for each sighting to the nascent table, using d3 to do so. After that, I looped through again to add the actual data to the row that was appended for it in the previous step.  The html document sources this js code and presents it in a webpage format. 

The filter function for this project sets up a user-input. When input is entered the event of a "filter table" button click happens, the code searches through the data table and check to see if the input information matches the table record. If it does, it goes into the results bucket and is then displayed in the webpage.
